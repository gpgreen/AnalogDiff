#AnalogDiff Library

Analog to Digital differential conversion for an Atmel AVR ATmega644 mcu.

The library will read positive diffential input on ADC3 and negative differential input on ADC2 with a 10x gain. At this time no configuration of the differential hardware is implemented. The source code would have to be changed for a different configuration.

To get the differential reading, call the method `read()`, it will return the ADC output after conversion is finished. The int returned contains the 16bit word generated by the hardware.
